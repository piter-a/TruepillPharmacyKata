Pharmacy Stock Kata completed as a part of of the application process for Truepill

## Introduction
The aim of this task was to implement a simple, console-based application which will allow the
pharmacist to firstly, add medicine to the formulary and then, ased on the formulary the application should
allow the pharmacist to update stock levels of various medicine. Note that only the medication in the
formulary can be added to stock.

To write the code I have used javascript in Visual Studio Code

To install javascript, run the following command in the VSCode terminal:
-npm install node

Inside of VSCode I have also installed the "Code Runner" extension,
this can be done by going to the extensions tab in VSCode and searching for
"Code Runner" and then installing it.

I have then run the code using ctrl+alt+n inside of VSCode
